# BBStore

This was a final project created by Andrea, Russell, Patrick, and Nick. We created a scam website using swing that has some interesting
and not so well made images of animals made by Andrea in photoshop. Users can add animals to their cart and the total's are automatically 
updated. It follows an MVC pattern, has a login page, and even some spooky music when the program loads.
